# StudentResumeManagement
Project I made in my senior year at Murray State University.

# Project Information
Instructor; Dr. Solomon Antony
Date: Fall 2023 Semester
Sponsor: Dr. Victor Raj
Client: Murray State University
Group Members: Kristopher Myers

# Problem
As a faculty member of Murray State University, Dr. Raj gets contacted by many employers asking
if there are students at MSU that meet certain requirements like having certain certain skills, 
having certain certifications, or graduating by a certain date to name a few. Now, going through 
and asking every student to send in their resume and then analyzing them to determine who has 
the skills an employer requires would be a long and tedious process.
